 Checks location of annotation on language elements.
 This check ensures that all annotations are adjacent to their siblings. This means that if there
are blank lines between any annotations, or annotations and their targets (what they're annotating such
as a field, constructor, etc.) then the check will fail. Javadoc comments are also invalid in this check and
will also raise an error.

 &lt;p&gt;
 Attention: Annotations among modifiers are ignored (looks like false-negative)
 as there might be a problem with annotations for return types:
 &lt;/p&gt;
